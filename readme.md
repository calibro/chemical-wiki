# Chemical wiki
This website is a visual report of the research workshop did at the UvA organized by the [Chemical Youth](http://chemicalyouth.org/) team together with [Calibro](http://calib.ro) and [Gabriele Colombo](https://twitter.com/marioponte).

## Description
In the ChemicalYouth research group at the University of Amsterdam, we wondered how these trends, the elite of editors, and the formalization of sources in Wikipedia, are expressed in articles about psychoactive and designer drugs. We are interested in drugs which are located at the fringes of the biomedical life sciences, such as Ayahuasca and LSD, and in substances which are newly created by communities of hobby chemists and so-called psychonauts. Information about such substances is often located in grey literature and created through non-experimental research.

During a data sprint between 11-15th July 2016, we gathered anthropologists, digital media scholar, statistician and designers in order to explore two questions:
1. How does knowledge about risks and potential benefits of drugs travel in Wikipedia?
2. How is knowledge about (new) designer drugs established?

4. Go to [website content](http://prose.io/#calibro/chemical-wiki/)
5. Start adding/editing. [Here](https://github.com/calibro/chemical-wiki/blob/master/_explorations/readme.md) you can find a small guide to add articles
6. You can explore the website [here](https://calibro.github.io/chemical-wiki)

### Additional information
Prose.io editor relies on Markdown syntax you can find more [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
Furthermore the Markdown parser used is ```kramdown``` which adds some [cool features](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).
