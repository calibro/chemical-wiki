### Introduction and “How to read”

In order to get a better insight into the dynamics of the development of the articles on the substances in focus, we build this map. It shows the development of the size of the article page in MB. The longer an article, but also the more pictures and tables it features, the larger its size. With growing public interest and knowledge about a substance, and an increasing relevance of Wikipedia, substance articles also grow. An unstable page size can be an indication of disagreements about the content among the editors, it can be caused by vandalism, or by splitting one article into several sub-articles.
The normalized view of the map removes relative differences between small and large pages, and only shows the relative changes in the size of the page. The absolute view also gives an indication which pages are bigger and smaller in absolute numbers, but the changes can be less clear. We also added an option to remove vandalism. Singular acts of vandalism on pages can increase the page size to a very large number, e.g. by adding large amounts of nonsensical text, or to zero, by removing the page. Such extreme values can be removed from the map for better readability.
