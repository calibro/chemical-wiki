### Introduction and “How to read”

In order to explore changes in the content of the Ayahuasca article over time, especially concerning the topics of medical benefits as opposed to risks, we explored the changes in the Table of Contens as a proxy. Instead of reading the different versions of the article, we only looked at the section headings. Thus, we can see when a certain topic is introduced into the article and how it moves around inside the article.
This graph shows when a topic appears or is changed on the X-axis (timeline). The Y-axis corresponds to the location of the topic in the article: higher up means the section is located at the top of the article, closer to the x-axis means it can be found at the bottom of the article.
Due to the mass of data, we did not look at all the section headings, but only at those with connection to the topics of positive and negativ **effects**, **research**, **uses**, and **safety**. The location of one section at a certain point in time and at a certain place in the article is represented by a coloured dot on the graph. The size of the dot corresponds to the size of the section, its colour to one of the aforementioned categories.
