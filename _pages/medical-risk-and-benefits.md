We wanted to look at a set of psychoactive substances which are rather popular and frequently used, and about which much knowledge exists. This is why we looked at the following seven drugs:

Ayahuasca

Cannabis

DMT

Ketamine

LSD

MDMA

Psilocybin


All of these substances are also controversially discussed concerning their risks and benefits. While some studies and viewpoints emphasize the risks associated with them, others point out their potential medical benefits.
