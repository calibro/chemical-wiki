The maps in this website are not perfect. The protocols and the methodologies we used to extract, analyse and display the information from Wikipedia are still highly experimental. Though imperfect and tentative, we hope that our visualizations will still be useful for the researchers and the actors interested in understanding how the knowledge of psychedelics and designer drugs has been established and stabilized on Wikipedia.
